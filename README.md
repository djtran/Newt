**As of right now when you open a new tab, hit `Tab` 3 times to focus the command prompt.**

A proper hotkey for focusing the prompt will come soon. At that time, the `Tab` key will be overriden to autocomplete commands.

### Current Functionality
- Commands and command history (Can browse with arrow keys)

### Supported Commands
- clear
- exit
- hello
- help (super basic)

### To Do List

_Functionality in order of priority_

1. Prevent newtab from autofocusing omnibox
2. Hotkey to focus prompt input
3. Tab autocompletion
4. .bashrc (at the very least PS1 & bash syntax, I want to customize my shell prompt :D {Note: vi needs to be completed before this point})
5. Google Drive API (make a folder for saving files in case they want to be accessed locally)
6. Settings page / .Xresources (colors, font settings)  
7. About page (sysinfo, about/suggestions)

_Commands_  

- cowsay
- ls
- ps
- vi (or some basic text editor in general)
