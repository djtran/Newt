# Newt

**As of right now when you open a new tab, click anywhere on the page to focus the prompt**


### Current Functionality
- Commands and command history (Can browse with arrow keys)
- Colored outputs!
- Autocomplete for commands and for bookmarks in current directory.

### Supported Commands
- clear
- exit
- hello
- help  (super basic)
- ls    (just bookmarks so far)
- cd _folder_   (just bookmarks)
- nav _string_ (either title of bookmark in current folder or a url)

### To Do List

_Functionality in order of priority_

1. Prevent newtab from autofocusing omnibox (doesn't seem possible as of now. sigh.)
2. Hotkey to focus prompt input
3. .bashrc (at the very least PS1 & bash syntax, I want to customize my shell prompt :D {Note: vi needs to be completed before this point})
4. Google Drive API (make a folder for saving files in case they want to be accessed locally)
5. Settings page / .Xresources (colors, font settings)  
6. About page (sysinfo, about/suggestions)

_Commands_  

- cowsay
- ps
- vi (or some basic text editor in general)
